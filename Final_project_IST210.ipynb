        "  Our group project is creating an ER diagram linked to Dave and Busters that has five tables. We picked this project because we like Dave and Busters a lot and it was the best idea we came up with when we thought of ideas in the first project. We thought Dave and Busters could be something we could use successfully. We started the project by brainstorming what different tables we could use to make this work. We came up with five tables that we could use to represent Dave and Busters and included these in our 2nd group submission. When we revisited the ER diagram for this final submission, we kept the same tables and just made some minor changes that were suggested to us on our last submission comments. This led us to our final ER diagram and being done with that stage of the project."

        "The specifics to our project are the staff members, each staff member serves a certain amount of customers. And for them to do this the restaurant needs to pay them, which then takes away from Dave n Busters profit. The DNB card has all of the customers' information on it. It shows his transactions, whether it be food, games or prizes. It also shows what staff member served him and how much they tipped them. It's different from the game card because the game card only has the amount of token you have left to play games and the amount of tickets you have for prizes. The game card ID is linked to the DNB card so if you lose it you can get another one. The game card shows what games you played, how much you spent on that game and the amount of tikets you won from that game."

        "For our ER diagram we decided to include five tables; games, customer purchases, prizes, customers and staff. Each of these tables is a major component to how Dave n Busters makes their profit. Starting with the customers. If they didn't have customers they wouldn't have a business. The rest of the tables all rely on the customers too. The tables prizes, staff and customer purchases all focus around the customer. The staff members serve the customers and then are paid. The staff's salary takes away from Dave n Busters profit. The customer purchases show how much each person is spending. The prizes are what the customers choose from playing games and earning tokens. Prizes cost money to buy but a profit is made from the amount of money a person spends to play games. The more expensive the prize, the more tokens, which means more money spent on games."

        "A scenario for an average user wanting to use our diagram would be the CEO of Dave n Busters. Something he would use our ER diagram for would be to see what part of Dave n Busters is making enough money and not enough money. For example, he could look at the prizes and see they are spending 150 dollars on the prizes but are only making 155 dollars from the prizes. This isn't that great of a profit, so they could see this and change their prices for Prizes. They could do this for any of our tables. They could also see what type of customers they are getting and if they're making more money from kids or adults. This could help them improve who they are marketing to. If they market to kids they can do more deals for birthday parties and make games more expensive. But if they market to adults they could improve food, make it more expenisve and set up deals for drinks. Doing all of this will help improve Dave n Busters profits, and this would be crucial information for the CEO. "
