        "For the Pet Shop diagram I decided I need to create six tables to make my diagram work. The six tables I have our Customer, Loyalty Program, Transaction of food, transaction of the pets, enclosures and inventory of the food. My main table that connects to three other tables is \"customer\", in this table I have five different attributes. The primary key is 'Loyalty ID' which is the ID you use when you, the customer, purchases anything from the store. When you show your loyalty ID the purchase rewards are sent to the loyalty program. I also have loyalty contract as an attribute, its something each customer has to sign to be eligible for the loyalty program. The other attributes are the address, first and last name of the customer. The 'customer' table connects to both the transactions of food and pets. An attribute in both of the transaction tables is the 'loyalty ID'. This needs to be in both tables because the loyalty ID is included in each purchase, which can then be seen by the manager. The table \"Loyalty program\" is connected to customer because the loyalty program is dependent on the customer signing up for it. If theres not customers then there is no loyalty program. The program allows the customers to receive discounts and rewards when their points are added up, they recieve points through buying things in the store. And through the transactions, your loyalty ID pops up which is then documented in the loyalty program. I decided to have transactions of food and food inventory in two different tables because the manager said he wanted to have those interactions be seperated. Food inventory is the food used to feed the animals living in the Pet Shop. I used the attribute 'FoodID' to connect transaction of food and food inventory because it doesn't matter what your'e doing with the food, you still need to keep track of it. For the table about enclosures, I connected this table to transactions of pets. I did this through the attribute of Pet code. Pet Code is the code each pet has on him to show his interactions in ths store, whether he has been purchased, is sick, where he is kept. All this information could be found by searching for his pet code. "
